<h1>CodeWars Challenges: <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/DevColeman">Visit Here</a></h1>
A personal repository where I solve and share coding problems daily, committing to a minimum of one problem each day to enhance my programming and problem-solving skills. It's my go-to space for practicing algorithms, exploring data structures, and preparing for technical interviews.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

This is how I learn about some of the abstract methods and the peculiar quirks of JavaScript.

## Optimizations

I solved the problem on my own first, then analyzed better solutions to compare their performance with mine. This process revealed areas for improvement, allowing me to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of my code.

## Lessons Learned:

Each day, I realize how much more there is to learn and see how I can always improve.
